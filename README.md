# qw

QuickWrite (qw) - Vim-like command line editor with a lot of features written on React.js and Ink.

Key features:
- FULL customisation. You can customise everything! Any used color! Any hotkey! Just like in Arch
- Everything important without any additionals, but you can install (or write your own) packages! Editor, tool for show etc.

TODO:
- [ ] Basic editor
- [ ] File showing system (eq. of `cat`, but with syntax highlighing and other things)
- [ ] Package system (ex. `qwi py` -> install package with python's syntax highlighting and error checking)
