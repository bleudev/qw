# qw

QuickWrite (qw) - Vim-like command line editor with a lot of features written on React.js and Ink.

Key features:
- FULL customisation. You can customise everything! Every color! Every hotkey! Just like in Arch
- Everything important without anything extra, but you can install (or write your own) packages! Editor, `cat`-like tool with syntax highlighting and scrolling using arrow keys, just like in `man`, etc.

TODO:
- [ ] Basic editor
- [ ] File showing system (like `cat`, but with syntax highlighting and other things)
- [ ] Package system (ex. `qwi py` -> install package with python's syntax highlighting and error checking)

## Install

Run this command to install qw:
```bash
# npm install -g qweditor
```

## Configure

Edit `~/.config/qw/config.yaml` to configure `qw`. If you haven't one, just run `qw` once. `config.yaml` will create automatically with default values.
